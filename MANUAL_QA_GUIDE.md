3. Confirm the app stays on the same exercise.
4. Confirm it shows:
   - `Почти! Давай разберем.`
   - the child's answer;

   - a short explanation;
   - the `Продолжить` button.
5. Click `Продолжить`.
6. Confirm the next exercise opens, or the summary opens if it was the last exercise.

Correct answer transition:

1. Open `/child/practice`, a focused grammar practice, or a word topic session.
2. Choose a correct answer.
3. Confirm the next exercise opens immediately, without a blocking feedback screen.
4. Confirm there is no 5-10 second delay after a correct answer.
5. Confirm no `Продолжить` button is required for a correct answer.
6. On the last exercise, confirm the summary opens immediately after a correct answer.

Focused grammar practice:

1. Open `/grammar`.

Possessive fill gaps must include context:

- `Anna has a bag. This is ___ bag.` Correct: `her`.
- `Tom has a dog. This is ___ dog.` Correct: `his`.
- `They have toys. These are ___ toys.` Correct: `their`.

Critical errors:

- wrong answer auto-advances before the explanation can be read;
- focused grammar practice mixes another grammar topic;
- a possessive fill gap appears without context, for example bare `These are ___ toys.`;
- several answer options are grammatically correct but the app accepts only one.

Curated topic blocks:

1. Open `/child/words/topics`.
2. Confirm these cards are visible in `Быстрые учебные блоки`:
   - `Вопросительные слова`
   - `Местоимения`
   - `Дни недели и время`
   - `This / that / these / those`
   - `-ing actions`
3. Open each block with `Учить`.
4. Confirm the topic training starts and is not empty.

Topic shuffle check:

1. Return to `/child/words/topics`.
2. Open the same quick block or database topic again.
3. Confirm the word/card order is not fixed between runs.
4. Confirm answer options are shuffled and still include the correct answer.

Grammar duplicate check:

1. Open `/grammar`.
2. Confirm `Personal pronouns` appears once.
3. Confirm `Possessive words` appears once.

## 8. Pages To Check

- `/login`
- `/parent/dashboard`
- `/parent/children`
- `/parent/courses`
- `/parent/cards`
- `/parent/import`
- `/parent/progress`
- `/child/select`
- `/child/dashboard`
- `/child/practice`
- `/grammar`

## 9. Critical QA Failures

- Build or typecheck fails.
- `.env.local` is tracked by Git.
- Supabase service role key is used in frontend code.
- Starter 350 creates duplicates.
- Child can edit parent cards/settings.
- Practice session starts but attempts are not saved.
- Review schedule is not updated after card attempts.
- Child practice shows empty or impossible exercises.

## 10. Statistics During Development

During development, parent statistics can include older Codex/API test sessions and attempts. This is normal if the same parent/child profile was used for several smoke tests.

The dashboard now counts completed sessions only when:

- `finished_at` is not empty;
- `total_attempts > 0`.

Empty sessions and unfinished sessions do not count as completed lessons and do not affect the lesson streak.

`Всего попыток` means all saved answers for the family. `Заданий в последнем занятии` means only the latest completed session.

## 11. How To Check With A Clean Child

Use this when you want a clean statistics check without old test attempts:

1. Open `/parent/children`.
2. Create a new child profile, for example `QA Child`.
3. Open `/parent/import`.
4. Make sure Starter 350 is available. Re-running it is safe and should not create duplicates.
5. Open `/child/select`.
6. Select the new child.
7. Open `/child/practice`.
8. Complete exactly one full session.
9. Open `/parent/dashboard`.
10. Check that `Завершенных занятий` increased by 1 for this new child's attempts in the family data.
11. Check that `Последнее завершенное занятие` shows the same number of tasks as the completed practice summary.
12. Open `/parent/progress`.
13. Check `Последние ошибки` if you intentionally made mistakes.

## 12. Child Profile Management

Archive a child:

1. Open `/parent/children`.
2. Click `Архивировать` near a child.
3. Open `/child/select`.
4. Confirm the archived child is not shown.
5. Confirm the child appears in `Архивные профили` on `/parent/children`.

Restore a child:

1. Open `/parent/children`.
2. Find `Архивные профили`.
3. Click `Восстановить`.
4. Open `/child/select`.
5. Confirm the child is available again.

Reset child statistics:

1. Open `/parent/children`.
2. Click `Обнулить статистику` near one child.
3. Read the confirmation text.
4. Type `RESET`.
5. Confirm reset.
6. Open `/parent/dashboard` and `/parent/progress`.
7. Confirm progress data for that child no longer affects attempts, sessions, streak, weak cards, or recent mistakes.

Reset must not delete cards, courses, Starter 350, or another child's data.

## 13. Reading And Listening Texts QA

Add starter texts:

1. Run `npm run content:report`.
2. Apply `supabase/seed_starter_texts.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor or with Supabase CLI.
3. Open `/parent/import`.
4. Click `Добавить Starter Texts`.
5. Click it again and confirm inserted count is 0 or the UI says the pack already exists without creating duplicates.

Check child reading:

1. Open `/child/select` and choose a child.
2. Open `/child/dashboard`.
3. Click `Тексты`.
4. Confirm `/child/texts` shows text cards with English/Russian titles, topic, difficulty and word count.
5. Open one text.
6. Confirm English text is visible and Russian translation is hidden.
7. Click `Слушать` and `Слушать медленно`.
8. Click `Показать перевод`, then `Скрыть перевод`.
9. Click `Ответить на вопросы`.
10. Answer all questions and confirm summary shows total, correct answers, mistakes and correct answers.
11. Click `Повторить слова из текста` and answer vocabulary tasks.
12. Open `/parent/progress` and check text attempts/text accuracy appear.

Check parent text management:

1. Open `/parent/texts`.
2. Create a short test text with 2-3 questions.
3. Edit the title or text.
4. Archive it and confirm it disappears from `/child/texts`.
5. Restore it and confirm it appears again.

Critical failures:

- Translation is visible before clicking `Показать перевод`.
- Text questions do not save to `practice_attempts`.
- A different family can see the text.
- Archiving a text deletes attempts or cards.
